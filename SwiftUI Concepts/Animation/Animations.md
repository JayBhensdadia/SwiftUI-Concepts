#  Animations in SwiftUI

## Implicit animation
---
* we tell our views ahead of time “if someone wants to animate you, here’s how you should respond”, and nothing more. 

* modifier that is used is **scaleToFill()**
    * it takes values greater than 0
    * value 1 is equivalent to 100% of its size
